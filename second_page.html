    <h3>history of pottery</h3>
    <p id = 'main'> Pottery is the process and the product created by combining clay with other raw materials 
        and firing them at high temperatures. This makes the product hard and durable which can be later painted
        and glazed. Pottery is mainly used for tableware, decorative ware, sanitary ware, or can be really any 
        structural product. 
    </p>
    <p class = 'A'>Pottery dates back to 29,000 - 25,000 BC, originating before the Neolithic period. However, there
        have been other discoveries of pottery vessels from Japan, China, South America, and Africa that may say otherwise.
