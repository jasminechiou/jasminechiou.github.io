    <h3>an introduction</h3>
    <p id = 'main'> Hi my name is jasmine and I am currently on my last semester at Northeastern University as a 
        data science and marketing analytics major. Something that I am passionate in is creating and painting pottery.
        I have taken a couple of classes and would love to take more and create pieces I am proud of and can give away as gifts. 
        I want my next pottery piece to be a matcha bowl that contains a spout so it is easier for me to pour it into a cup. I also 
        like the idea of gifting my creations to my loved ones. 
    </p>
    <button id = 'navigateButton'> learn more about pottery! </button>

    <script>
        const navigateButton = document.getElementById("navigateButton")
        navigateButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
            window.location.href = 'second_page.html';
        }
    )
    </script>
